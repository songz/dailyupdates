# Saturday, Jan 3
## Personal
* Garden
  * 8am went to hire labor for pulling out weeds in garden
  * Paid him $100 for 7 hours of work. He really worked hard
  * Bought small and large pick
* Repaired garage door and installed a latch
* Watched TV the whole day
* Went running, Bill Fong Song James
* Spent the rest of the day watching blacklist

## Notes
* Wasted the whole day
* Originally offered $80 for manual labor and planned to tip $20. When he arrived, he said he wanted $100. This bothered me a little, but if you thinking about it, manual laborors are not used to tips and cant depend on the fact that they will receive tips for good work. When negatiating with manual laborers, I should tell them straight up, "$80 for the job, an extra $20 if you do good work"
