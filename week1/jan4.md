## Sunday, Jan 4
## Personal
* Gardening
  * Planted Fongs moms plant
  * Moved weeds into backyard for compost
    * In hindsight, should have been doing this yesterday while the gardener was working. Could have used some help
  * Dumped some fertilizer into weed pile, realized that it was probably pointless. Fertilizer should be mixed with dirt
* Got Boba from bobo
* Watched 3 episodes of blacklist
  * Watching 3 episodes of blacklist resulted in sleeping late. Should not happen again.

## Work
* add additional input components - select, textarea, etc.
* Input radio buttons were not css styling like other boxes. Learned that I should be using form-control-static class
* popover info icon is dynamically generated by json object
* Correct input fields
