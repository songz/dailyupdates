## Fuckups
* Yesterday I called two shipping services to ship my bike from LA to SF. I decided to go with the second shipping company, but did not notify the first company. I gave the first company my CC and even though I didnt sign any agreement, they went ahead and called a driver to pick up the bike. Now there is 2 drivers from 2 different companies picking up one bike.
  * The moment I get an update, I should notify all affected party immediately. Its a sign of respect. Lesson learned

## TODO
